Not just jobs, but heroic callings suitable for a main character.
* **Hero-** More of a lifestyle brand than a job, these maniacs risk life and limb for fame, fortune and glory. Backed by the power of Narrativium, amazingly they don't all end up a wet splat in some tomb somewhere!
* **Trespasser-** Explores the world for the glory of the homeland! Makes friends (or not) in interesting places.
* **Assassin-** Knows how precious life is and will charge for it dearly and accurately. Typically upper crust or children of recently wealthy families, they are trained in deportment, a wide variety of arts and sciences, politics, mathematics and of course, inhumation
* **Thief-** Responsible for the redistribution of wealth in a professional, courteous manner. Often responsible for meting out justice to unlicensed thieves as well. What's yours is mine, take it from me! Wait no, don't do that! 
* **Beggar-** They have their ear to the ground, their foot in the door and their finger on the pulse of society. They'll leave you alone if you pay them.
* **Seamstress-** Negotiable Affection and socks darned while you wait!
* **Merchant-** Covers any trade which is not specified elsewhere. Many have their own guilds.
* **Watchman-** Not the most glamorous vocation, but an often noble one. Not only are they frequently near danger, but are also responsible for exercising restraint rather than just caving some lout's head in. 
* **Fool-** There's nothing funny about being the personal punching bag of the most powerful rulers on the Disc. They must be quick-witted and tough to endure their lot in life. Heavy is the head who wears the crown and jangly are the shoes which caper to please them.
* **Minstrel-** Entertainers, story-tellers, travelers and musicians. These eclectic travelers must earn their way through personality alone.
* **Wizard-** Students and graduates of a school of magic earn instant respect (fear) wherever they go. They manipulate some of the most dangerous forces in the universe and are expected to be well-read and knowledgeable to boot.
* **Witch-** Often incognito, frequently misunderstood, always dangerous to any who would get in their way. A good witch works for the betterment of all, demanding her due in respect and "donations".
* **Priest-** A devotee of one of the many Gods of the Disc. Attitudes, sanity and goodness may vary.
* **Monk-** Not to be confused with a Priest. These people dedicate their lives to a purpose not connected with Gods such as time, balance, and what it really means to be cool.
* **Artificer-** Whether serious and grim or starry eyed and wild, these creators harness the physical forces of nature in order to make devices of wonder and power. They also blow things up, sometimes on purpose!
