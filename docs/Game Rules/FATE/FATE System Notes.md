# Basics
Roll 4 Fate Dice and count the net total. Compare that to the challenge. The difference is the Shifts.
## Ladder
A measure of success or failure in shifts.
You tell the players the opposition number before they decide what to do. They can also roll first then Invoke second to help the result.

| Shifts | Rating    | Description                                                        |

| 4      | Great     | The maximum  possible without some kind of advantage or help.      |

| 2      | Fair      | Success. Slightly difficult for a hero.                            |
| 1      | Average   | Success. A regular challenge for a normal person. Nothing special. |
| 0      | Mediocre  | Tie. Easy even for a normal person.                                |
| -1     | Poor      | Fail.                                                              |

# Aspects
Affect how you interact with things and what you can invoke or compel.
* Game Aspect - Permanent parts of the world, its problems and issues. Default is 2: Current issue and upcoming issue
* Character Aspect - Change over time and are about a character's defining traits such as backgrounds, features, relationships, problems, goals, titles, important possessions, etc.
* Situation Aspect - Temporary and are meant to be invoked and compelled right now!
* Consequences - Temporary but lasting negative traits you take to avoid being taken out in a conflict.
* Boost - One time use in the moment. You get them when you don't succeed enough for an advantage or as a bonus.
	* Can't compel or pay to invoke again.
	* Can promote to an Aspect, giving it free invokes.
## Invoking
Use an aspect to give yourself benefits. It must be relevant. You can roll first, then invoke.
* +2 to your current skill
* Reroll
* Pass +2 to an ally
* Add +2 to a passive opposition
### Free Invoke
You get 1 or 2 when creating an advantage.
