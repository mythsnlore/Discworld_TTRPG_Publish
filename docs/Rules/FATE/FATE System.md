### Discworld Aspects
* Stories want to be told and will find vessels to fill so they can take shape.
	* 1 in a million chances crop up 9 times out of 10
* Words have power, especially written words.
* Symbols have power
* Belief makes things real, especially collective generational belief. A single delusional person can't do much without leverage such as convincing others or access to magic.
* Law of Conservation of Reality: Magic has a cost proportional to its effect. Pay now or pay later, but you will pay.
	* 8 is the magic number (7a is used as a substitute)
* The world is a mirror of our own world. A funhouse mirror, but a mirror all the same.
* No matter how silly or unlikely, everything works. The world takes itself seriously.
