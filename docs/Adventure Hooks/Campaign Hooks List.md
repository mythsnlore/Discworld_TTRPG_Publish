### Real World Events
* Y2K/Mayan Calendar End of the World

* Brexit
* The Trans-continental Railroad
* Climate Change (and denial)
### Fairy Tale Based
* Pinocchio
	* Leonard of Quirm manages to transfer Hex, per its request, into the mobile body of a constructed automaton child. It then goes about learning all about how to be human by getting its ants drunk (on honey mead), running off to join the Disc Theater, and getting kidnapped.
* Alice Venturi in Howondaland
* The Brothers Grimm
### Classic Fiction
* Around the Disc in 88 Days
